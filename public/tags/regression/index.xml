      <description>Executive summaryPetit Poll has been asked by the Conservative Party of Ontario to survey the Ontario public in regards to the current COVID-19 pandemic to better understand whether people are likely to vote for the Party in the upcoming general election. We conducted a mock survey using simulated respondents to give a cursory look into the broader trends in public health awareness regarding COVID-19. However, since our survey included questions relying on respondents to report their personal habits and knowledge regarding COVID-19, we believe these responses could be embellished to view the respondent in a more favourable light.</description>
